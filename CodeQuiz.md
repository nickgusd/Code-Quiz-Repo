# Code Quiz ReadMe

Hello, welcome to my Code Quiz which was built almost entirely using JavaScript!

When I open the page I am presented with a start quiz button.
When I click the button the first list of questions begins as well as the timer.
If I click the write answer, I will get an alert that says correct and will display my current score and the time remaining.
if I click the wrong answer, I will get an alert that says wrong, and it will deduct a second from the timer.
Once I have completed all of the questions my score will be displayed and I can input my initials.
When the time is out, the final score will be displayed.
When I click the submit button, my initials and my score will be saved.
If I click the clear score button, my score will be cleared.
If I click the go back button, the quiz will retart.
